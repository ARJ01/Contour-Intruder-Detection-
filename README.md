# Contour-Intruder-Detection-
An OpenCV model with morphological operations

The very asic approaches towards this idea can be just a simple body detection with 
a haar-casscade or YOLO but for a exceptional approach and different applications I went for contour filtering 
morphological operations.
You can see the image attached to check the results of this project .
For Notebook : contact me !

I will wait for a response which tells me how this contour approach is different than the ones that are mentioned.
